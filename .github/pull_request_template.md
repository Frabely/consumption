## Test Evidence
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] `npm run lint`
- [ ] `npm run lint:docstrings`
- [ ] `npm run test:unit`
- [ ] `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] `npm run test:e2e` (or explain why skipped)

## Codex Review Findings
- P0:
- P1:
- P2:
- P3:

## Codex Review Gate
- [ ] Confirmed no open P0/P1 findings remain
- [ ] UI/UX states checked (loading, empty, error, disabled, focus, mobile)
- [ ] User impact and rollback risk documented
- [ ] Tests mapped to changed behavior (unit/integration/e2e or manual reason)
